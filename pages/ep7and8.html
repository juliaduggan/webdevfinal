            <h2>Episode 7: "The Ringing of the Bell"</h2>
            <p>Wirt and Gregory, now away from Beatrice, find themselves hiding in a cottage where they meet a young girl named Lorna. They hide from "Auntie Whispers", a woman who lives with Lorna and commands her with a bell that makes her follow the ringer's orders. Auntie Whispers keeps hinting at the fact that trespassers may get eaten if found. Soon enough, the brothers are found, and eventually come to realize the meaning of Whispers' hints.</p>
            <p>In this episode of "Over the Garden Wall," Wirt and Greg continue their journey through the woods in the rain and encounter the Woodsman, who warns them of the Beast's presence. However, they mistake the Woodsman for the Beast and run away. They seek refuge in a seemingly abandoned house where they meet Lorna, who is under the control of Auntie Whispers. When Auntie Whispers discovers the boys, they escape and realize that Lorna was the one eating people and Auntie Whispers was trying to keep her "wicked" side at bay. They eventually save Lorna by freeing her from the spirit possessing her. As they continue their journey, the Beast watches from a distance and reveals to the Woodsman that there is only one way - his way.</p>
            <h3>Trivia</h3>
            <p>The bell used to control Lorna is similar to the shpae of her dress</p>
            <h3>Quotes</h3>
            <p>Greg: [chasing his frog] You can run, and you can hide!</p>

            <h2>Episode 8: "Babes in the Wood"</h2>
            <p>Wirt has lost all hope of ever finding the way back home and so, after hearing the sound of The Beast's singing, he decides they should just go to sleep under a tree. After they fall asleep, Gregory has a dream about The Queen of the Clouds and The North Wind. While Greg was dreaming, the weather turned from fog to snow. At the end of the episode, after Gregory trades himself to the Beast in place of Wirt using his wish from the Queen of the Clouds, Wirt tries to chase him and ends up falling into a frozen lake. This is another appearance of a lake, this one being a direct correlation to the next episode where we find out exactly how Wirt and Greg ended up in The Unknown.</p>
            <p>The chapter begins with Greg, Wirt, and Greg's frog floating across a lake in an outhouse. They hear the beast's singing, which depresses Wirt. Wirt concludes that they are never going to go home and tells Greg he is too childish. Greg has a dream where he travels to Cloud City and becomes a leader, but accidentally releases the North Wind. He traps the North Wind inside a bottle and the Queen of the Clouds grants him a wish, which he uses to try and get home. The Queen says Wirt is already claimed by the beast, so Greg wishes for the beast to take him instead. Wirt wakes up to find Greg leaving with the beast, and chases after them. He slips on a frozen lake and falls in. Beatrice and the Fisher Fish save him and he passes out.</p>
            <h3>Trivia</h3>
            <p>Greg's dream is largely inspired by cartoons of the 30's</p>
            <h3>Quotes</h3>
            <p>Greg: Captain Wirt, do you know who's singing?</p>
            <p>Wirt: I don't know much of anything anymore.</p>
            <p>Greg: Oh. Did you know that dinosaurs had big ears but everyone forgot 'cause dinosaur ears don't have bones?</p>
            <p>Wirt: No, I-I didn't know that, Greg.</p>
            <p>Greg: That's 'cause it's not true. It's a rock fact!</p>
