            <h2>Episode 5: "Mad Love"</h2>
            <p>The central themes of "Mad Love," the third episode of the animated series "Over the Garden Wall," are death, mystery, and madness. The story contains several elements that point to the theme of death, including the need for two pennies to ride the ferry to Adelaide, the presence of Endicott's peacocks as symbols of immortality and eternal life, and the suggestion that Grey and Endicott may have passed away long ago. The mansion is described as a labyrinth where Endicott has lost his sense of self, and the episode is full of secrets, some answered and some remaining hidden. The question of Grey and Endicott being ghosts or not is left ambiguous.</p>
            <p>The episode of Over the Garden Wall opens with Wirt, Gregory, Beatrice, and Fred the Horse at a dining table with Quincy Endicott, the wealthy owner of a tea company. Beatrice has convinced Endicott that the boys are his nephews, and he expresses delight in having company. Endicott reveals he dislikes his own tea and only makes it for money to expand his mansion. Endicott tells the boys about his obsession with a painting of the most beautiful woman he has ever seen, and he has fallen in love with a ghost. Wirt and Beatrice ransack the parlor searching for money, while Fred is sent to keep Endicott busy. Beatrice reveals she was once human, and she and her entire family were cursed after she threw a rock at a bluebird. Wirt admits that he has a crush on a girl, plays the clarinet, and whispers poetry to himself. Wirt has an insight into Endicott's ghost, and Endicott admits he's afraid that there is no ghost and that he has lost his mind. They all travel to the bedroom with the painting, and Endicott and the woman in the painting faint upon seeing each other, as they both thought the other was a ghost. They both claim ownership of the camellia garden, and it's revealed that the woman is Margueritte Grey, the owner of Endicottâ€™s primary competition in the tea business. Endicott and Grey romantically declare their love for each other, and Endicott gives Greg and Grey each a penny, providing the two pennies they need to ride the ferry.</p>

            <h2>Episode 6: "Lullaby in Frogland"</h2>
            <p>Wirt and Greg go on a lighthearted romp aboard the Frogland Ferry as they approach Adelaide of the Pasture.</p>
            <p>The main characters Wirt, Greg, and Beatrice sneak aboard a ferry and get caught by the guards, but Wirt disguises himself as a bassoon player and saves the day. Later, they arrive at the home of Adelaide, who they thought would help them return home, but they discover she is a wicked crone who plans to enslave them. They escape and Beatrice feels regret for her actions. The episode ends with Wirt feeling betrayed and the brothers continuing their journey.</p>
            <h3>Trivia</h3>
            <p>After Wirt and Greg sing "Adelaide Parade" on the steamboat, Wirt starts laughing. Elijah Wood moved away from the microphone and started laughing after recording the song, this is why his laugh isn't as clear as the rest of the dialogue. There is a video of this recording session in a behind the scenes video on Cartoon Network's YouTube channel.</p>
