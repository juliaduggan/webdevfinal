            <h4>Summary</h4>
            <p><span class="emphasis">Over the Garden Wall</span> is an animated television miniseries created for Cartoon Network by Patrick McHale, known for his work on Adventure Time and The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack. It was based on McHale’s animated short, Tome of the Unknown. The miniseries consisted of ten episodes that were broadcast throughout the week of November 3rd to the 7th, in 2014. McHale directed all the episodes, with Nick Cross serving as art director and Nate Cash as supervising director. The show is considered a critical and popular success, with an 8.8/10 rating on IMDb and the recipient of the 2015 Reuben Award from the National Cartoonists Society. The story features two half-brothers, Wirt and Gregory, who have become lost in a mysterious wood called The Unknown and attempt to find their way home with the help of the Woodsman and Beatrice the bluebird. The atmosphere in The Unknown is generally menacing although there are many moments of playful whimsy. Many of the episodes are rooted in folktales and children’s stories from the 19th and early 20th centuries while the style of animation and storytelling borrow heavily from early cartoons. The series is inspired by myths and old wives' tales that have been passed down throughout the years.</p>
            <p><span class="emphasis">Tome of the Unknown</span> is from Cartoon Network Studios shorts program and won the best animation short film at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival in February 2014. It is written and directed by Patrick McHale, who is also known for working on Cartoon Network's Adventure Time. The pilot episode aired in film festivals such as LA Shorts Fest and Ottawa in September 2013, and at Austin Film Fest in October 2013. On May 19, 2015 the pilot episode released on Cartoon Network.</p>
